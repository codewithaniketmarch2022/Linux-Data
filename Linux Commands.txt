- / This symbol represents a root directory...

1) pwd  -it is an present working directory command , this shows you in which directory you are currently in..

2) cd  - This command is used for enter from one directory to another directory,This is change directory command. If you want to enter back from root directory to present working directory this command is used.... 

2) cd /  -it is used for to enter in root directory..

2) cd ..  - If we want to go to parent directory of current working directory this command is used..

2) cd FolderName/  -suppose we are in current working directory and after that we want to open directly folder from there then this command is used..

-Imp note -
***********
what are the links in linux-  A connection between file name and the actual data on the disk.....we can call it a shortcut......
1) soft link-A symbolic link, also termed a soft link, is a special kind of file that points to another file,
link will be removed if the original file removed or deleted.......
e.g  ln -s /cdac/1/2/3/ viransh            -so here /cdac/1/2/3/ is the path of file for that we want to create a shortcut.....and viransh is the name of file where data is a pointed of given path folder.....
if in folder 3 there is a one file and contain some data then it will shows in viransh file(by using cat command.......)

2)hard link-there is a no any effect on link file of renamng,deleting or removing the file
e.g ln ../cdac/1/2/3 viransh        - so here /cdac/1/2/3/ is the path of file for that we want to create a shortcut.....and viransh is the name of file where data is a pointed of given path folder.....
if in folder 3 there is a one file and contain some data then it will shows in viransh file(by using cat command.......)but here if we create changes in original file then this are automatically links with shortcut file.....


98)echo   -The echo command in Linux is a built-in command that allows users to display lines of text or strings that are passed as arguments. It is commonly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.
e.g  echo "Geeks for Geeks"    -by using this it will print string Geeks for Geeks on the terminal......
e.g  echo -e "Geeks \bfor \bGeeks"    -by using this it removes all the spaces in between the text and prints GeeksforGeeks...........

e.g  echo -e "Geeks \cfor Geeks"     -by using this command we can print only data before \c i.e Geeks....

e.g  echo -e "Geeks \nfor \nGeeks"    -this option creates a new line from where it is used.
e.g  echo *      -this command will print all files/folders, similar to ls command.


99)sed  -SED command in UNIX stands for stream editor and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.....
e.g  sed 's/unix/linux/' file1.txt   -The below simple sed command replaces the word “unix” with “linux” in the file1.txt....
e.g  sed 's/unix/linux/2' file1.txt   - The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word “unix” with “linux” in a line.
e.g  sed 's/unix/linux/g' file1.txt    -he substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.
e.g  sed 's/unix/linux/3g' file1.txt   -The following sed command replaces the third, fourth, fifth… “unix” word with “linux” word in a line.
e.g  sed '3 s/unix/linux/' file1.txt   -You can restrict the sed command to replace the string on a specific line number....
e.g  sed '5d' file1.txt   -it will delete 5th line of file1.txt
e.g  sed '$d' file1.txt   -it will delete last line of file1.txt
e.g  sed '3,6d' file1.txt  -it will delete data from 3rd to 6th line of file1.txt
e.g  sed '12,$d' file1.txt  -it will delete a data from line 12 to last line of the file.......


100)chown  -if you want to provide file ownership from one user to another user in that case this command is used...
e.g  chown -c veer file1.txt  -here file ownerships are changed from user aniket to user veer of file1.txt but for that user veer must be already existed in the system then it will be possible........ 

101)su  -Su is the abbreviation for “Switch User”.The su command allows you to run a shell as another user.
syntax  -  su <username> 
e.g  su veer  - it switch(change) the user from aniket to veer and after that user is a veer........ 

102)gzip  -this command is used for compress a file.......
e.g  gzip file1.txt   -here file1.txt is a file which is a compressed by using gzip command........after execute file1.txt.gz file is created

103)gunzip  -gunzip uncompresses a file that was compressed with gzip......
e.g  gunzip file1.txt.gz   -here file1.txt.gz is compressed file which is decompressed by using gunzip command.....after execute file1.txt file is created.......

104)ping  -it is stands for packet internet grouper......it is used for check the network connectivity or internet connection....
                               -------How ping commands work---------
-if we want to check out system is connected to particular server or not in that case this command is used...
 so we use the ip address of server with ping command and passing some packets of data to server if server gives response in form of 0% packet loss then consider there is good network connectivity with server, if server gives response in form of 100% packet loss then consider there is no network connectivity between system and server,if server gives response in form of 50% packet loss then consider there is half network connectivity between system and server because of multiple traffic on server thats why it gives only 50%
-if packets are more then it will take more time on terminal in that case press ctrl+c for stop the responses on terminal after that it will display final result in following format---50 packets transmitted, 50 received, 0% packet loss, time 62085ms


e.g  ping hostname              -you can use host name like www.google.com  
e.g  ping ip_address of server
e.g  ping -c 3 hostname         -only sending 3 packets to server in that case this command is used.......
e.g  ping -c 3 -q hostname      -if you dont want to see responses only want to see summary in that casae this                                  command is used......

e.g  ping -f hostname           -to send packets as fasat as possible to test the networlk performance....
e.g  ping -w 10 hostname        -it will stop the print responses after 10 seconds and gives us final results
e.g  ping -D hostname           -it will print timestamp of result summary to remember the time......
e.g  ping -a hostname           -it will gives us one audible signal when response is given from server.....

105)feh  -if you want see image on terminal then in that case this command is used......
e.g  feh imagename    -it will display image on the terminal......


105)wget  -this command is used for downloads files,png images and also any pdfs from server(different website) in that case this command is used......
e.g  wget image_address   -it will saved the image in working directory from the server(website)...and if you                            want see this image on terminal then press  feh image_name...............

e.g  wget -p 1/2/3/ image_address  -here 1/2/3/ is another directory address...-p is used for save the image                                     or  file in different directory, instead than current directory.......
  
e/g  wget pdf_address  -it will save the pdf in working directory from the server(website)...then if you want
                        see the data ofpdf file then you can use cat command........
