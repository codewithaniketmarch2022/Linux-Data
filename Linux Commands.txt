2) If we are in present working directory and we want to enter in that directory having directory name with space for e.g My Book is the directory name so in that case we can enter in that directory by following way...   cd "My Book"

3) clear  -This command is used for clear all terminal..

4) ls   -This command list all the files and directories in the present working directory......

if file already present it will ask you override or not if you press y then it will override and if you press n it will not override the file or data .......

36)cp -R dirname1 dirname2  -suppose dirname1 is a directory which contains some files and this directory we want copied inside another directory i.e dirname2 which is not already exist in that case for copy purpose this command is used.......
e.g cp -R cdac boss   -here cdac is directory which contains multiple files and we want to copy this cdac directory into boss directory which is not already exist, so boss directory will be created after copying...

41)mv dirname1 dirname2  -if you want to move directory(dirname1) inside directory(dirname2)which is not already exist in this case only content of directory(dirname1) is moved inside directory(dirname2) but not actually directory(dirname1) is transferred...
e.g  mv cdac boss  --here boss directory is not already exist in that case only content of cdac directory is moved inside the boss directory but actually full cdac directory not moved.........this all is happen because boss directory is not already exist there....

42)mv -v filename1 dirname1   -if you want to move file(filename1) inside a directory(dirname1) and also showing the moving structure or steps of file into directory in that case this command is a used....v stands for varbos....

48)nano Filename.extension    -if we want to create a different kinds of files(if file is already exist then ok or if not existed then after file creation 1st save that by ctrl+O) with extensions in that case this command is used...
e.g  nano abc.txt  - here abc.txt is text file is created by this command(if this file is already exist then ok or if not existed then after file creation 1st save that by ctrl+O)...if you want to exit from file then press ctrl+x...
other shortcuts are also available at bottom of file window there........

49)sudo-long form of sudo is super user do........
sudo  -it allows you some extra privilleges or authority as an administrator or power user......
e.g mkdir cdac  -cdac is directory...if you want to create a directory in configuration files so that is not directly possible it will give you permission denied error in that case this problem is solved by using sudo command.....this command allows you a permission......so we can use this command in following ways...
e.g sudo mkdir cdac

50)top      -this commands provides a dynamic realtime view of your running system..for e.g if you want to know which process in your computer which taking more memory in cpu or system that will know by this command.........
when you press key i then it will allows you to just filter out any ideal process..only running processes will show there not ideal procesess shows........after you press i it will show complete running process

51)chmod -if we want to change the file permissions(like read,write and execute) then in that case this command is a used............

Imp note - 
**********
-if you want to know the pid of processes which are running in yor system so that will be know you by using command 
 that is   ps -ux

51)kill pid(it is in number format) -If you want to kill the processes in linux in that case this command is used........ but for that you should want to know the pid of process which you want to kill....
e.g  kill 3286  -3286 is pid of process that i want to kill... after press enter it will kill the process...

                  or (another strong command for kill the process as follows)
e.g kill -KILL pid(it is in number format)  -it will kill the process which is a running...

                  or (another strong command for kill the process as follows)

e.g kill -9 pid(it is in number format)  -this is called sigkill command...it will kill the process which is a running...

-File permission -there are main 3 file permissions-
1) read- r   -it means read or open the file......
2) write-w   -it means try to edit that file.....
3) execute-x -it means tyr to run that file....

permissions(rwx) levels-
u -yourself(current user)
g -group in which user belongs to
o -others
a -all

how to see the permissions-
ls -l

structure of permission follows - 
********************************
 - rwx rwx rwx
 1  2   3   4               

1. File type:  - indicates regular file and d indicates directory.....  
2. Read,Write & Execute permission for the file owner......
3. Read,Write & Execute permission for the group owner of the file.....
4. Read,Write & Execute permission for the all other users.....

-How to change permissions - 
****************************
 -if you want to giving write and execute permission to user(u) then use following ways command-
                                 chmod u+wx filename
 -similarly we can use permissions like read,write and execute for group(g) and others(o) also....
 -for permission removing of user(u),group(g) and others(o) we can use commands in following ways
                                 chmod u-wx filename
 -if we want to adding permissions for all(a) then we can use following command.....
                                 chmod a+rwx filename
 -if we want to removing permissions for all(a) then we can use following command.....
                                 chmod a-rwx filename
